1,Beasts,"Beasts are animals that harm or deceive humans, often acting with unusual intelligence or malice.",/images/motifs/categories/Beasts.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Beasts.png,#901306,"In Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, beasts, which can also be referred to as animal-spirits, occupy a liminal position between the natural and the supernatural. Voyant Tools analysis shows that words such as “creature” and “beast” frequently are used to describe animal-spirits, emphasizing their indeterminate status: not fully animal nor fully demonic. Adjectives such as “great” and “wild” recur alongside these nouns, foregrounding physical scale and untamed energy rather than moral intent or psychological depth.  Unlike ghosts or fox-spirits, which often speak and display moral intentions, beasts are defined by bodily force, appetite, and violence. They erupt suddenly into human spaces and are presented as embodiments of raw spirit.","One portrayal of beasts in Strange Tales is “Wild Dog,” in which the beast is a nightmarish predator with a man’s body and an animal’s head that feeds on corpses while terrorizing the living, emphasizing beasts as agents of violence and fear. “The Giant Turtle” portrays a colossal, ancient creature described as extremely difficult to kill and capable of continuing to attack even when mutilated. Finally, another portrayal exists in “The Black Beast,” which emphasizes fear through obscurity and darkness rather than sustained physical threat. Overall, these stories show the nuanced nature of beasts while reaffirming certain themes present in the characterization of these animal-spirits."
2,Demons,"Demons are malevolent beings that prey on human weakness, feeding on fear, desire, or disorder.",/images/motifs/categories/Demons.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Demons.png,#508C78,"In our Voyant Tools analysis, one word that specifically popped up in both stories was “evil,” suggesting that compared to other more benign or mischievous spirits, demons in Strangle Tales from a Chinese Studio are framed through a more morally charged lens. They are defined less by ambiguity or emotional entanglement and more by their active capacity and intent to harm, corrupt, or disrupt human order. This linguistic emphasis aligns with Pu Songling’s broader portrayal of demons as embodiments of malevolence, often serving as cautionary forces rather than objects of sympathy or unfortunate circumstance.","In both “The Magic Sword and the Magic Bag” and “Sheep Skin,” demons appear as overtly hostile forces that threaten human life and moral order. Unlike fox spirits or ghosts, they are explicitly marked by violence and an unmistakable association with evil and were only defeated in “The Magic Sword and the Magic Bag” by the use of powerful talismans and weapons (such as the bag swallowing the yaksha demon). In contrast, in “Sheep Skin” the demons are assisting the King of the Nether World, Yama, in ripping off the skin of a man, imparting upon him “indescribable agony in the process.” In both stories, demons function less as morally ambiguous figures and more as embodiments of cruelty and retribution, reinforcing clear boundaries between human order and supernatural evil."
3,Dragons,"Dragons govern rain and water, appearing as powerful but regulated forces within the heavenly order.",/images/motifs/categories/Dragons.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Dragons.png,#ECA637,"In Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, dragons function less as antagonistic monsters and more as embodiments of cosmic order and power. Unlike Western dragon portrayals that emphasize conquest, heroic slaying, and destruction, Pu Songling’s dragons are aligned with water, weather, and longevity. They often remain unseen or “dormant,” exerting influence indirectly through “natural” means. Even when dragons do not appear in physical form, their presence is greatly influential in the structure of the narrative world, indicating the role that dragons played in Chinese folklore.","Across “The Alligator’s Revenge,” “Dragon Dormant,” “Sunset,” and “The Stone Bowl,” dragons appear in varied but thematically consistent ways. In “The Alligator’s Revenge,” an alligator is described as dragon-like and wields destructive control over water, punishing humans with sudden flooding. “Dragon Dormant” presents an image of a dragon as completely concealed. In “Sunset,” dragons are fully realized as aristocratic beings: the Golden Dragon King presides over a palace. Finally, “The Stone Bowl” evokes dragon power indirectly, imbuing its destructive supernatural force within an object rather than the creature itself. Together, these stories show how the portrayal of dragons is ultimately flexible."
4,Fairies,"Fairies are cultivated spirits who take human form, forming relationships with mortals through chance or fate.",/images/motifs/categories/Fairies.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Fairies.png,#E33928,"In Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, fairies are primarily portrayed through language emphasizing beauty and refinement rather than danger. By analyzing frequencies using Voyant Tools, we were able to see use of words like “beautiful” and “radiant” around these fairy figures, marking them as visually elevated and associated with calm or light. This emphasis on appearance often places fairies in situations where human characters confront desire or illusion, suggesting that fairy beauty functions less as a threat and more as a test of human attachment and perception.","In “The Painted Wall,” fairies appear within a temple mural, whose beauty draws the scholar Zhu into an illusory painted world shaped by his desire. The encounter ultimately reveals his, and maybe humanity’s in general, to let go of illusion and attraction. In “Coral” the fairy figure is a Heavenly Apsara living among humans in a restrained and compassionate relationship; her beauty is paired with moral discipline, and she supports spiritual growth rather than temptation, presenting a more benevolent and guiding role."
5,Fox-Spirits,"Fox spirits assume human beauty and clever speech, living on desire, illusion, and long cultivation.",/images/motifs/categories/Fox-Spirits.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Fox-Spirits.png,#2C833C,"Fox-spirits occupy a uniquely expansive and complex role within Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, functioning as Pu Songling’s most used vehicle for exploring intimacy, desire, and moral ambiguity. Unlike many other spirits in the collection, foxes are repeatedly granted social depth: they form families, maintain lineages, enact long-term place, and even pursue revenge across generations. This capacity for kinship distinguishes fox-spirits from demons, ghosts, or beasts, which are more often solitary or lack emotions. As a result, fox tales tend to be noticeably longer than other stories in the collection, allowing Pu Songling to stage extended relationships rather than brief encounters or moral shocks.\n \n From a linguistic perspective, Voyant Tools suggests that certain words are used more often than normal in fox stories. Five words stick out that map directly onto the narrative logic of fox stories: love, strange, illness, clever, and beautiful. “Beauty” is consistently the fox’s point of entry into the human world: fox-spirits almost always appear first as irresistibly attractive women (although we can note that there are stories where foxes are male), drawing men into relationships that feel authentic even when their supernatural nature is suspected. “Clever” describes not merely trickery, but social intelligence as well. Foxes know how to speak, behave, negotiate, and love within human norms. They are able to manage households and participate in communal life, often passing convincingly as respectable members of society from long stretches of time.\n \n At the same time, fox intimacy is frequently entangled with “illness” and bodily decline. Relationships with fox-spirits tend to drain vitality, producing wasting sickness and exhaustion in human partners. This pattern aligns with the fox’s repeated association with siphoning life force through prolonged intimacy, that nature of which we see mirrored in more Western portrayals of fox-spirits like Ahri from League of Legends. A highlight of fox-spirits is moral ambiguity: some foxes punish lust, others reward devotion, and still others act out of familial obligation. Their actions are not governed by a single moral rule but by situational logic.\n \n The recurring use of “love” alongside “strange” is especially revealing. Fox relationships are repeatedly framed as genuine emotional bonds, not merely illusions or seductions (although these clearly do occur). At the same time, these bonds are consistently marked as “strange,” signaling that intimacy itself is the source of instability in these cases. Love in fox stories does not negate danger; instead, it intensifies it by making separation difficult and moral judgement unclear. The “strange” quality of these relationships lies in their dual status as both meaningful and harmful.\n \n Overall, fox-spirits function as Pu Songling’s most flexible supernatural figure. They are capable of affection, deception, social integration, and exploitation, often within the same narrative. Rather than serving a single moral purpose, fox stories examine how desire, beauty, and emotional attachment can coexist with social disruption.","Fox-spirit stories occur throughout the collection in a whole range of narrative roles. One story, “Fox Enchantment” serves as the clearest version of the fox as a lethal seductress figure: the fox admits that she has caused many deaths, and the human target becomes critically ill afterward. Another example is “Catching a Fox,” which provides insight on how foxes are not just encountered; they are pursued and “handled” as a category of disruption within ordinary life.\n \n Finally, “The Fox of Fenzhou” is significant because it portrays a fox-spirit who openly engages with human authority rather than hiding from it. Judge Zhu encounters a woman of extraordinary beauty whom he quickly identifies as a fox, yet he remains drawn to her. The story emphasizes the fox’s intelligence and composure rather than focusing on illness or punishment, demonstrating the range of moral and emotional outcomes fox stories can produce."
6,Ghosts,"Ghosts are the dead who cannot depart, lingering due to injustice, resentment, or unfinished ties.",/images/motifs/categories/Ghosts.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Ghosts.png,#85869A,"When analyzing the stories in which ghosts are present in Strange Tales using Voyant Tools, we find that ghosts are framed through a distinctive mix of fear, mortality, and emotional intimacy. Corpus analysis shows that “strange” emerges as one of the most frequently occurring words in ghost-centered stories, underscoring Pu Songling’s emphasis on ghosts as disruptions to the ordinary rather than purely monstrous threats. The frequent appearance of “death” reinforces ghosts’ close association with mortality, unfinished lives, and the afterlife. At the same time, Voyant Tools reveals a notable recurrence of the word “love,” suggesting that ghosts can often be motivated by affection and that humans can often feel desire or affection towards ghosts themselves. Overall, Pu Songling seems to portray ghosts broadly as emotionally complex figures who blur the boundaries of living and dead.","Ghosts are prevalent in several stories in Strange Tales, but among these stories, “Spitting Water,” “Wailing Ghosts,” and “Twenty Years a Dream” most clearly illustrate Pu Songling’s approach to ghosts. “Spitting Water” presents ghosts as nuisances sustained by fear rather than true power that specifically appears at the site at which she is buried, while “Wailing Ghosts” expands haunting into a collective expression of suffering. Finally, “Twenty Years a Dream” uses ghostly influence to question reality, time, and the truth after a man lives what he fully believes to be a long and fulfilling life before realizing it was only a dream shaped by ghosts. Together, these stories show that ghosts in Strange Tales are not merely frightening figures but narrative tools for examining fear, trauma, and the instability of human experience."
7,Giants,"Giants are monstrous figures of great size and strength, often violent and difficult to restrain.",/images/motifs/categories/Giants.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Giants.png,#4D4960,"Unlike ghosts and fox-spirits who speak, love, deceive, and reflect human concerns, giants in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio are emotionally lacking in depth. In the one potential story that depicts a giant, we can note that the depiction is mainly focused on size and strength rather than developing the monster into something beyond large and simple.","Giants do not have a significant presence in Strange Tales, but one noticeable story in which a giant seems to be depicted is “The Monster in the Buckwheat.” There are no real identifiable characteristics to figure out exactly what the monster is or what it looks like, but the attached image certainly depicts a large monster, albeit lacking distinctly human features."
8,Gods,"Gods are local or celestial authorities who judge conduct, grant protection, or enforce moral rules.",/images/motifs/categories/Gods.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Gods.png,#2A4ECD,"In Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, gods are presented as institutional and functional beings who uphold order rather than inspire reverence, similar to Zhongli, the God of Contracts in Genshin Impact. Whether acting as protectors, the King of the Nether World responsible for punishing humans, or to show how divine knowledge ought to be treated, gods in Strange Tales aren’t necessarily the all-powerful figures we think of from a Western perspective. They instead are portrayed as regulators of social hierarchy and moral boundaries.","Gods in Strange Tales appear most often in practical roles, intervening when social or moral norms are threatened or to impose punishment. As seen in “The Door God and the Thief,” they can be as simple as household gods protecting the home. In contrast, “The Taoist Priest of Mount Lao” depicts access to divine or sacred power as conditional and morally constrained and misuse leads not to empowerment but to ridicule and failure. Finally, in “Sheep Skin,” Yama, the King of the Nether World, imposes and instructs carrying out punishments."
9,Insect-Spirits,Insect spirits are small creatures that gain human form through long practice or hidden power.,/images/motifs/categories/Insect-Spirits.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Insect-Spirits.png,#090A44,"Insect-spirits in Strange Tales are minor supernatural beings that are limited in power and status. Pu Songling depicts these spirits as being able to assume human form and display refinement, but also highlights the fragility of their existence (which is also seen in “Butterfly”) and their refined nature. He illustrates that spiritual attainment does not erase hierarchy: unlike fox-spirits, gods, or demons, insect-spirits are easily displaced and are not overtly powerful in the human world.","In “The Girl in Green,” a young woman dressed in green and appearing delicate is captured by a spider after returning to insect form. Yu frees the woman, who gives him her thanks. In “Butterfly” the insect-spirits also take the form of beautiful young women, emphasizing the delicate nature of insects. "
10,Living Corpses,"Living corpses are dead bodies that rise and move, driven by dark energy or improper burial.",/images/motifs/categories/Living-Corpses.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Living-Corpses.png,#54AD99,"Living corpses represent a breakdown of naturalness and rationality rather than an expression of emotion or desire. Unlike ghosts, who often retain memory, speech, and feelings, the living dead are defined by bodily persistence without inner life. The girl in “Living Dead” is described completely lifelessly and without emotion, indicating that Pu Songling intended the physical abnormality to be frightening, rather than aspects of ghosts such as lingering feelings or unresolved conflict.","In Strange Tales, living corpses appear in “Living Dead,” in which a girl who appears to have died returns in a state that is neither fully alive nor dead. She chases a man staying in an inn and her movement is described as lurching and violent. It also focuses on the unsettling reaction to the girl, especially as they are unable to remove her corpse from the tree she is embracing."
11,Plant-Spirits,Plant spirits are flowers or trees that attain awareness and sometimes human appearance over time.,/images/motifs/categories/Plant-Spirits.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Plant-Spirits.png,#CC3B4C,"Plant-spirits don’t play a hugely active role in Pu Songling’s Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. Unlike other spirits or demons, plant-spirits rarely speak or act independently; instead, they function as visual and thematic markers of aspects of Chinese culture.","Plant-spirit imagery appears throughout Strange Tales even though plants are not fully personified. In “Butterfly,” the character Flower, though a butterfly-spirit, is closely tied to floral imagery such as delicacy. Additionally, in “Growing Pears” the magically produced pear trees behave as responsive beings, growing in front of the crowd at a pace impossible in nature. Finally, in “Princess Lotus,” a lotus-spirit that appears dignified, refined, and beautiful interacts with humans."
12,Skin-Changers,"Skin-changers take on human appearance by wearing or borrowing skins, concealing their true nature.",/images/motifs/categories/Skin-Changers.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Skin-Changers.png,#D48390,"In Strange Tales there are several stories in which the monster transforms from human to their natural form, yet the most shocking example of an entity that does such a thing is the skin-changer in “The Painted Skin.” Unlike fox-spirits whose transformation often involves emotion, seduction, or moral ambiguity, the skin-changer’s disguise is purely an instrument of predation and deception. The horror of the story lies not in the supernatural itself, but in the ease with which the false human exterior conceals violence and moral “emptiness,” making skin-changers one of the most disturbing figures in the collection.","Skin-changers are most prominently featured in “The Painted Skin.” In this story, a demon wears a carefully painted human skin to pass as a beautiful woman. The monster, green-faced and “having great jagged teeth like a saw,” was seen leaning over a human pelt, the skin of an entire human body, spread on the bed. This act of wearing human skin allows the demon to move undetected within human society, turning intimacy and domestic trust into sites of extreme vulnerability and reinforcing skin-changers as uniquely disturbing."
13,Snakes,"Snake spirits are deceptive and persistent beings, often tied to revenge, temptation, or obsession.",/images/motifs/categories/Snakes.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Snakes.png,#C7783D,"Snakes in Strange Tales are portrayed as deceptive, dangerous, and closely tied to illusion and desire. Similar to demons, snakes are consistently associated with physical threat and bodily harm, often punishing human greed, lust, or overconfidence. They also have the ability to shift between human and animal form, reinforcing the idea that appearances are unreliable and that beauty can conceal violence.","In Snake Island, a beautiful woman emerges from a landscape filled with flowers and beauty and seduces Zhang, only to vanish when a massive snake appears, which is theorized to also be her true form. In Flowers of Illusion, snakes appear through Taoist magic: a yellow sash transforms into a terrifying snake to punish theft, inducing the man to “[fall] terrified to his knees, his face drained of colour, and [beg] the Taoist to spare his life.”"
14,Trolls,Trolls are ugly and aggressive creatures that dwell far from towns and attack travelers or villages.,/images/motifs/categories/Trolls.png,/images/motifs/backgrounds/Trolls.png,#594724,"Trolls do not have a large presence in Strange Tales, only being presented in one of the stories. Similar to giants, the depiction of trolls is largely focused on physical appearance, specifically noting size, ugliness, and overall having a violent tone. Pu Songling did not particularly indicate trolls were intelligent or had any sort of character complexity (something that we often see in other types of spirits).","Trolls only make an explicit appearance in Strange Tales in the story aptly named “The Troll.” The troll was described as having a “face dark and blotchy like an old melon rind” and also wore “great shining fangs more than three inches long.” Similar to giants, the troll wasn’t necessarily portrayed as having emotional depth."
